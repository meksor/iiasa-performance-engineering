First of all, our computer is usually a device with **sensitive** mechanical parts.

!!! note
    We need to consider this for benchmarking, especially on mobile devices.

    Sitting on the couch with a computer in my lap, blocking air intake and exhaust.

### Throttling

Throttling in computers is a **negative feedback mechanism** to protect sensitive electronics or conserve battery.
If your devices' components become too hot their **performance will decrease intentionally** to protect them from degredation and breakage. Mobile devices may try decrease their power usage by throttling.
Operating systems often have high-level *"performance profiles"* that have an impact on this.

This will obviously have an effect on benchmarking results.

!!! note
    (Thermal) throttling on computing devices...

    Semiconductors will increase in conductivity and eventually burn out or degrade the hotter they get. This means all long-running semiconductors need some sort of negative feedback with every increase in temperature. Thermal throttling.

    Usually this is accomplished via low-level firmware coupled with at least one temperature sensor within the device assembly. On mobile devices like laptops throttling might also occur with the decrease of battery voltage and charge.

    High-level system settings like the power profile will also impact your benchmarking results:
