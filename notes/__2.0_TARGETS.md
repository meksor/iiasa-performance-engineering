!!! -

### Memory Usage
How much memory is my program using? (at peak/on average)

!!! -

### Latency
How fast can my program respond to I/O?

!!! -

### Persistent Storage ?
For long term storage: How many drives do I need?

!!! -

### ... Predictablity
Is there variance in the above? How large is it? Can we predict when it happens?
