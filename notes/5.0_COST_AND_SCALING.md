### Cost & Scaling

Scaling up your processors' performance is often considered harder and more expensive than adding more RAM. 

!!! Our components cost $money$ and vary in their ability to be scaled.


```
%/(((*##/,#%##,%%*&##*((/*%%(#,@,*
((*,*,*#,/##(((/,(*(#(/(**/*,*%(.#
((/(%%(*/*(##(*(##/(#%/(/(#(**(#,(
%(//#,/*%(//#/&(/(&(,%&(,(,#%,*(*(
.((*(,#**(#&#**/&(***///,%#,/((#*(
*/,(,##(%(,%%(//(,##///##((##*((*/
##/((/((//#((*/(*((*(/#(//(#*/((((
(#**(((#*///*(%/(/(/**(#,(/%%(,*(,
%(,(,/(/.(&*.(/##((%,**(/(*((/,(,/
##/((/((//#((*/(*((*(/#(//(#*/((((
*//*/#&/#%((#,*,/##/%/(*/(*,#(#,**
//#,**/##*(#%/,*//(/(#((#,,/((,((*
/%*/*(**//,##*(/%%(/(*,(*(*/./,#((
```

... On the other hand: you probably dont want to cache gigabytes of completely random noise ...

    Strange thought experiment...

    Strange example with an alternate universe where 100 people have to say a special incantation for one hour for each bit in each RAM stick. (in this universe we are better off computing the result again than storing it in memory)
