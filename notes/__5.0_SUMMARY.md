## Summary

#### Choose Optimization Target and Consider Trade-Offs

"I want to increase my programs run-time and/or concurrency metrics by caching results thereby using more memory."

!!! - 

#### Limit Throttling Behaviour and Errors

- Set your laptop's power profile and plug it in
- Use a desktop PC
- Use a server in a datacenter

Consider ambient factors like room temperature, air conditioning and so on.

Make sure your CPU is as idle as possible: close programs, stop daemons, log out other users, etc...

!!! - 

#### Account for Error

Run benchmarks multiple times and do statistics. Use a benchmarking framework/write your own.

!!! -

#### Understand your Tools

Consider your programming language and understand your profiler.

!!! note

    Now that we have an enviroment for testing set up, we can start thinking about "Datastructures and Algorithms" as well as their complexity.
