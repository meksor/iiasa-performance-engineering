    Welcome.

    Welcome everyone. As you already know I will be talking about the basics of "Performance Engineering" today. 

**High-level/Scripting** Focus

!!! note 
    High level scripting focus. No low level techniques, topics, datastructures.

Benchmarking in **Python**

    Python: The *Slowest* Language

    I will be using python as a test subject. Python can be considered "the slowest language" although things have gotten a lot better recently. 

Let us gain perspective ...

!!! -
    We can take a look at our computer and its performance from different perspectives that can be useful.

    I don't want to regurgitate every book, video and blog post there is on python performance engineering. 
    Rather I want to give you some perspectives through which to judge benchmarks and performance metrics.
