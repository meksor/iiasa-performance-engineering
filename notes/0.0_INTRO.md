    Welcome.

    Welcome everyone. As you already know I will be talking about the basics of "Performance Engineering" today. 

**High-level/Scripting** Focus

!!! note 
    No: CPU cache optimizing, branching vs unconditional code, low-level datastructures, context switchint, etc...

    Since we are mostly working in scripting languages this talk is going to focus on high-level performance engineering only. This means I will not be talking in detail about things like: the CPU cache, branching/unconditional code, low level datastuctures like linked lists vs vectors vs buffers etc, context switches/forced pipeline flushing or any other extremely finicky technique.

Benchmarking in **Python**

!!! note
    Python: The *Slowest* Language

    I will be using python as a test subject. Python can be considered "the slowest language" although things have gotten a lot better recently. 
    It also has many pitfalls, allocates a lot of memory in advance and has a robust and predictable but slow memory management technique. This technique and its implementation ("reference counting") also thus far prevented python from having "true concurrency". [Basically any operating-system process by python can only execute one python byte-code instruction at a time](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).

Starting with a **Quick Summary of the Basics** ...

!!! -
    Let's get started with the basics.

    Very often there are trade-offs we have to consider. These are real-world considerations, economical or scientific in nature. For example: *In some way* More RAM is cheaper than a better CPU.

    We can take a look at a computer from different perspectives that can be useful.
