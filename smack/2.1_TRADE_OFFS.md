## Trade-Offs

!!! note
    Optimizing performance can become a consideration of trade-offs.

    Very often there are trade-offs we have to consider. These are real-world considerations, economical or scientific in nature. For example: *In some way* More RAM is cheaper than a better CPU.


### CPU vs RAM
Scaling up your processors' performance is often considered harder than adding more RAM. 

!!! note 
    CPU vs RAM Scaling

    ... and  scaling CPUs is harder than scaling RAM, hence "caching" is very prevalent. It might become impossible to increase CPU clock speeds so we have to start computing in parallel - and that might not be possible at all.

```

... On the other hand: you probably dont want to cache gigabytes of completely random noise ...

(This is perlin noise, you might want to pre-compute that depending on what you are doing.)
