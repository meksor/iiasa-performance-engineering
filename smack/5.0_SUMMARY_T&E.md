## Summary

Limit throttling behaviour:

- Set your laptop's power profile and plug it in
- Use a desktop PC
- Use a server in a datacenter

Consider ambient factors like room temperature, air conditioning and so on.

Make sure your CPU is as idle as possible: close programs, log out other users, disable ssh server (actually dont do that if you are on a remote machine :D), etc...

Run benchmarks multiple times and do statistics. Use a benchmarking framework/write your own.

Consider your programming language and understand your profiler.

Now that we have an enviroment for testing set up, we can start thinking about "Datastructures and Algorithms" as well as their [COMPLEXITY](COMPLEXITY.md).
